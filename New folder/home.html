      <h3>What is <u>MINIGURU</u></h3>
      <p>Children are naturally<b> curious and creative</b>. They have uncanny ability to learn. Unfortunately this is not given sufficient weightage in their education.</p>
      <p>Miniguru.in is unique platform, dedicated to children to nurture their inherent creativity. Miniguru aspires to give space to children to learn and grow in an environment of trust, responsibility and freedom. <b>Miniguru</b> is a hub of children’s dream and ideas, encouraging children to execute at their pace and interest.</p>
      <p>We help schools and parents to create a physical space for their children; named <b>T-LAB</b>, which consists of different work stations and is a resource repository with a variety of tools, materials and references. T-LAB is a space for ‘doing’. Children decide their own list of things to do and their own way of doing things.</p>
      <p><b>Miniguru.in</b> avail facilities to channelize their project work in a planned and constructive manner. These processes boost children’s confidence and keep their motivation alive. Miniguru gives opportunity to reflect and share their ideas and projects which they<b> receive constructive feedback</b> from their peers.</p>
      <p>In other word, it is a clear platform where they learn from their own, and the peer play a role of guru by giving feedback and reflection on their projects. That is why we named it Miniguru, a unique and ever evolving peer learning space. </p>
      <p>The miniguru.in is group of <b>MINIGURUs</b> to each other.</p>

  <h2 class="p-2">Founder's Desk:<u>Pramod Maithil</u></h2>
<p class="p-2"><b>Philosophy:</b>“When students were asked whether they have ever been bored in class,<b>83percent of NAIS  students</b>  answered  that  they  were  bored  sometimes(50percent) or often (33percent), compared with 86 percent of public-school students (36percent) were bored sometimes; 50 percent were bored often) –HSSSE report 2016.i”<br>
  This statement is just to bring the issue that significant numbers of students are disengaged in schools.<br>
  Allow me to state<br>
<b>“Schools are not academically attractive place for children”</b>.<br>
<b>The fact is “children don’t enjoy the way their education is done”.</b><br>
 I made some attempt to respond to this issue with my capacity and have wonderful insights and learning.<br>
I got opportunity to work with well-known organizations in education domain <b>Eklevya</b>, MP and <b>Sahyadri School</b> (KFI )Pune as research associate and teacher. By this time my daughter was 4 year old and her schooling was a big discussion in my family, interestingly my relatives were more worried about. I was happy with the way my child was growing, not fully confident with the way early schools function around.</p>

        <div class="modal-body"><p>
          According to this, the quality education in real sense can be achieved if the agency of children be given role in their education. We need to believe in children. We require developing activities, materials, processes and let the children   learn   and   grow   according   to   their   interest   and   pace,   in   an environment of trust, responsibility and freedom.<br>
A   diagrammatic  for  the  Natural  Learning  Model  -The graphics on the left can be created just by placing uniform  squares   at  different  angles   while   keeping  the same center. A perfect circle emerges in the middle. The focus was on the center and squares. Not on, how the circle is forming. <br>
In terms of education, ‘aspired learning objective’ relatesto the bigger circle which is a by-product, and which would emerge later. We only need to focus on the center which is ‘happiness of the child’ and the squares are ‘different exploration in an aspired domain’.<br>

Pointers of the ‘Natural Learning Model’ <br>
1. Recognize agency of children in their education<br>
2.‘Learning’ is a ‘by-product’ of the child’s efforts<br>
3. Learning is not linear process<br>
4. 3 elements of Effective facilitation<br>
  a.Believe in children.<br>
      b.Teachers need to shift from an authoritarian role.<br>
      c.Let children make mistakes.</p>

         <p>I realized that children of different T-LABs are showing great creativity, but it is shared among limited group. During the Covid 19 lock down, Schools are attempting to go online. Children demanded for the T-LAB activities as well, I tried to explore possibilities to engage children in creative activities, inside their houses.<br> I got remarkable response from kids in this. I got connected with a number of children from different T-LABs. They all have collected waste and few cutting-pasting stuff and tools from their own houses and setup a dedicated corner as home T-LAB for their creative ideas and projects. With this pilot, I visualize a virtual platform for few of the T-LAB processes like currency system, planning and sharing. This gives opportunity to connect different T-LAB together, also open up opportunity to create individual T-LABs.
